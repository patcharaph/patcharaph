👋 Hello, I'm Patchara (Pae)
🎯 A passionate lifelong learner making a bold career pivot from Finance to AI.

🧭 My Story
I'm Patchara, age 44, with a background in Food Process Engineering (KMITL, 2003) and an MBA in Financial Management (NIDA, 2008). I began my career in factory planning at Nestlé Thailand, then transitioned into finance, serving over 15 years at TSFC Securities as Assistant Vice President, Treasury Department. My responsibilities included liquidity management, bond trading, and portfolio analysis.

Driven by a passion for continuous learning, in 2025 I decided to pivot towards technology—specifically Artificial Intelligence and IoT. While working full-time, I am now pursuing an online Master’s in AI & IoT at Thammasat University (TUXSA Program), dedicating my free time to building skills in programming, machine learning, and AI applications.
